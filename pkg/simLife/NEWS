This file is intended for further news about bug fixes and further modifications of the package.


Changes with 0.5
-------------------
1) The package now has no dependencies to the package 'unfoldr' anymore. As a consequence 'particles' and
 'ferrit' objects (either as spheres, prolate or oblate spheroids, cylinders with height zero) as implemented
  in the previous versions by the functions 'simParticle' and 'simFerrit' are
  no longer available and have to be generated by the user calling 'unfoldr::simPoissonSystem' using the
  types 'prolate' or, respectively, 'spheres'.
  
2) In addition, all functions referring to the lengths of the major, minor (and also the second minor) axis of
 spheroids are now updated to get the correct lengths.
 
3) When calling the function 'densifyCluster' the user has to update whether the moved and densified objects are still
 interior objects which means no intersection with the lateral planes of the simulation box. Here the user must call 
  'unfoldr::updateIntersections' and manually modify the densified cluster regions. 
 
4) The function 'simCluster' now requires a random ball system as an input which defines the cluster regions
 of some particle or fibre system.
 
5) Note that some names have changed. The 'length' element in a cylinder system has now changed to height 'h' since this
 naming is more precise in what it means. For prolate and oblate spheroids the semi-axis length now are
 stored as a vector of length three under the name 'acb'. For any further details please see the manual. 

6) Parallel processing is provided either by a multicore approach using 'mclapply' (unless windows is used) or
 as recommended using an cluster environment (MPI/SOCKS/PSOCKS)
