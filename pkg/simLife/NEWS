This file is intended for further news about bug fixes and further modifications of the package.


Changes with 0.5
-------------------
1) The package now has no dependencies to the package 'unfoldr' anymore. As a consequence 'particles' and
 'ferrit' objects as implemented in the previous versions by the functions 'simParticle' and 'simFerrit' are
  no longer available and have to be generated by the user calling 'unfoldr::simPoissonSystem' using the types
  'prolate' or, respectively, 'spheres'.
  
2) In addition, all functions referring to the lengths of the major, minor (and also the second minor) axis of
 spheroids are now updated to get the correct lengths.
 
3) When calling the function 'densifyCluster' the user has to update whether the moved and densified objects are still
 interior objects which means no intersection with the lateral planes of the simulation box. Here the user must call 
  'unfoldr::updateIntersections' and manually modify the densified cluster regions. 
 
4) The function 'simCluster' now requires a random ball system as an input which defines the cluster regions
 of some particle or fibre system.
